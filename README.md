# omm

‚ú® Overview
---

`omm` (stands for "on-my-mind") is a keyboard-driven task manager for the
command line.

`omm` is intended for those who need to frequently rearrange tasks in their
to-do list. It lets you move any item to the top of the list, add tasks at
specific positions, and adjust task priorities up or down, all via one or two
keypresses.

ü§î Motivation
---

The fundamental idea behind `omm` is that while we might have several tasks on
our to-do list ‚Äî each with its own priority ‚Äî we typically focus on one task at
a time. Priorities frequently change, requiring us to switch between tasks.
`omm` lets you visualize this shifting priority order with a very simple list
interface that can be managed entirely via the keyboard.

üíæ Installation
---

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install dhth/tap/omm
```

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/omm@latest
```

Or get the binaries directly from a
[release](https://github.com/dhth/omm/releases).

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

### TUI

`omm`'s TUI allows you to do the following (all with one or two key presses):

- create/update tasks at a specific position in the priority list
- add a task at the start/end of the list
- move a task to the top of the list (indicating that it takes the highest
    priority at the moment)
- move task up/down based on changing priorities
- archive/unarchive a task
- view archived tasks
- delete a task

#### Tweaking the TUI

The list colors and the task list title can be changed via CLI flags.

```bash
omm \
    --tl-color="#b8bb26" \
    --atl-color="#fb4934" \
    --title="work"
```

### Importing tasks

Multiple tasks can be imported from `stdin` using the `import` subcommand.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | omm import
Order new ACME rocket skates
Draw fake tunnel on the canyon wall
Assemble ACME jet-propelled pogo stick
EOF
```

Tip: Vim users can import tasks into omm by making a visual selection and
running `:'<,'>!omm import<CR>`.

### Adding a single task

When an argument is passed to `omm`, it saves it as a task, instead of opening
up the TUI.

```bash
omm "Install spring-loaded boxing glove"
```

Outputting tasks
---

Tasks can be outputted to `stdout` using the `tasks` subcommand.

```bash
omm tasks
```
