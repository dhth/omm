command line.

ü§î Motivation
---

The fundamental idea behind `omm` is that while we might have several tasks on
our to-do list ‚Äî each with its own priority ‚Äî we typically focus on one task at
a time. Priorities frequently change, requiring us to switch between tasks.
`omm` lets you visualize this shifting priority order with a very simple list
interface that can be managed entirely via the keyboard.

üíæ Installation
---

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install dhth/tap/omm
```

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/omm@latest
```

Or get the binaries directly from a

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

### TUI

`omm`'s TUI is comprised of several views: 4 lists (for active and archived
tasks, one for task bookmarks, and one for prefix selection), a context pane, a
task details pane, and a task entry/update pane.

#### Active Tasks List

As the name suggests, the active tasks list is for the tasks you're actively
working on right now. It allows you to do the following:

- Create/update tasks at a specific position in the priority list
- Add a task at the start/end of the list
- Move a task to the top of the list (indicating that it takes the highest
    priority at the moment)
- Move task up/down based on changing priorities
- Archive a task
- Permanently delete a task

#### Archived Tasks List

Once you're done with a task, you can archive it, which puts it in the archived
tasks list. It's more for historical reference, but you can also unarchive a
task and put it back in the active list, if you need to. You can also
permanently delete tasks from here.

#### Context Pane

For tasks that need more details that you can fit in a one line summary, there
is the context pane. You add/update context for a task via a text editor which
is chosen based on the following look ups:

- the "--editor" flag
- $OMM_EDITOR
- "editor" property in omm's toml config
- $EDITOR/$VISUAL
- `vi` (fallback)

#### Task Details Pane

The Task Details pane lets you see all details for a task in a single scrollable
pane.

#### Task Entry Pane

This is where you enter/update a task summary. If you enter a summary in the
format `prefix: task summary goes here`, `omm` will highlight the prefix for you
in the task lists.

#### Tweaking the TUI

The list colors and the task list title can be changed via CLI flags.

```bash
omm \
    --tl-color="#b8bb26" \
    --atl-color="#fb4934" \
    --title="work"
```

omm offers two modes for the visual density of its lists: "compact" and
"spacious", the former being the default. omm can be started with one of
the two modes, which can later be switched by pressing "v".

```bash
omm --list-density=spacious
```

This configuration property can also be provided via the environment variable
`OMM_LIST_DENSITY`.

Compact mode:

Spacious mode:

### Importing tasks

Multiple tasks can be imported from `stdin` using the `import` subcommand.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | omm import
orders: order new ACME rocket skates
traps: draw fake tunnel on the canyon wall
tech: assemble ACME jet-propelled pogo stick
EOF
```

Tip: Vim users can import tasks into omm by making a visual selection and
running `:'<,'>!omm import<CR>`.

### Adding a single task

When an argument is passed to `omm`, it saves it as a task, instead of opening
up the TUI.

```bash
omm "Install spring-loaded boxing glove"
```

### Configuration

`omm` allows you to change the some of its behavior via configuration, which it
will consider in the order listed below:

- CLI flags (run `omm -h` to see details)
- Environment variables (eg. `OMM_EDITOR`)
- A TOML configuration file (run `omm -h` to see where this lives; you can
    change this via the flag `--config-path`)

    Here's a sample config file:

    ```toml
    db_path      = "~/.local/share/omm/omm-w.db"
    tl_color     = "#b8bb26"
    atl_color    = "#fabd2f"
    title        = "work"
    list_density = "spacious"
    show_context = false
    editor       = "vi -u NONE"
    ```

Outputting tasks
---

Tasks can be outputted to `stdout` using the `tasks` subcommand.

```bash
omm tasks
```

ü§î Tips
---

These are some tips to improve your experience of using `omm`:

- Set up discrete instances of `omm` if you need to. You can do so by
  referencing a different config file (which points to a unique database) for
  each instance, or by directly using `--db-path` flag. Eg. an omm instance for
  personal tasks, and another for work. Set up as many `omm` instances as you
  need.
- Use `omm updates` to stay up to date with omm's latest features/changes.
