You can permanently delete a task by pressing `<ctrl+x>`. This will put omm in
an "awaiting confirmation" mode, where you can press `<ctrl+x>` again to proceed
with the deletion, or press any other key to cancel it.

This is omm's default behaviour. If you'd rather omm not ask for confirmation,
you can set the `--confirm-before-deletion` flag to `false`.

Go ahead, create a test task, and permanently delete it.
