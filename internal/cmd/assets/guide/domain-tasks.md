omm (**on-my-mind**) is a task manager. You can also think of it as a keyboard
driven to-do list.

As such, tasks are at the core of omm. A task can be anything that you want to
keep track of, ideally something that is concrete and has a clear definition of
done.

Tasks in omm have a one liner summary, and optionally, some context associated
with them (like this paragraph). You can choose to add context to a task when
you want to save details that don't fit in a single line.
