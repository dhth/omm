As mentioned before, once a task is created, you might want to add context to
it.

You do that by pressing `c`. Go ahead, try it out. Try changing the text, and
then save the file. This context text should get updated accordingly.

Once saved, you can also copy a tasks's context to your system clipboard by
pressing `y`.
