You can filter tasks in a list by pressing `/`. Doing this will open up a search
prompt, which will match your query with task prefixes.

Try it out now. You get out of the filtered state by pressing `q/esc/<ctrl+c>`.

Note: You cannot add tasks or move them around in a filtered state. But, you can
press `‚èé` to go back to the main list and have the cursor be moved to the task
you had selected in the filtered state.
