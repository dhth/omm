A task can be in one of two states: **active** or **archived**.

This list shows active tasks.

To be pedantic about things, only the tasks in the active list are supposed to
be "on your mind". However, there are benefits to having a list of archived
tasks as well.

Press `<tab>` to see the archived list.
