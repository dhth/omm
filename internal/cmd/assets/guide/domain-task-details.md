The **Task Details** pane is intended for when you want to read all the details
associated with a task in a full screen view.

You can view this pane by pressing `d`. This pane is useful when a task's
context is too long to fit in the context pane.

Whilst in this pane, you can move backwards and forwards in the task list by
pressing `h/←/→/l`. You quit out of this pane by either pressing `d` again, or
`q/esc/<ctrl+c>`.

Try it out. Come back to this entry when you're done.
