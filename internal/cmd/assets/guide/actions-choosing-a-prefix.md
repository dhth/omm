Once you've added a few tasks, you can use the **Prefix Selection List** to
quickly choose a prefix for your next task. This is intended to make creation of
new tasks easier.

Go ahead, try it out.

Press `a/o/O/I/A` to start adding a new task, and then press `<ctrl+p>`. Choose
a prefix from the list and press `‚èé`.
