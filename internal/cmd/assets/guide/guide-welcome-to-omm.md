Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for trying out **omm**.

This is a guided walkthrough to get you acquainted with omm's features.

Before we begin, let's get the basics out of the way: you exit omm by pressing
`q/esc/<ctrl+c>`. These keys also move you back menus/panes whilst using omm's
TUI.

Onwards with the walkthrough then! Simply press `j/â†“`, and follow the
instructions.
