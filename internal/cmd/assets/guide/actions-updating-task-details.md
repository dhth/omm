Once a task is created, its summary and context can be changed at any point.

You can update a task's summary by pressing `u`.

This will open up the the same prompt you saw when creating a new task, with the
only difference that the task's summary will be pre-filled for you. This can
come in handy when you want to quickly jot down a task for yourself (either by
using the TUI, or by using the CLI (eg. `omm 'a hastily written task
summary'`)), and then come back to it later to refine it more.

Similarly, you can also update a task's context any time (by pressing `c`).
