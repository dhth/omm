Sometimes you want to quickly create a task as a copy of an existing one instead
of starting from scratch. To do this, press `Y` to copy the current task to
omm's memory. You'll see a message in the status bar confirming the task has
been yanked.

Next, move to the position in the list where you want to paste the copied task.
Press `p` to paste it below the current position, or `P` to paste it above. You
can paste as many times as you need.
