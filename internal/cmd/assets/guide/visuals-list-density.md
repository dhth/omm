omm's task lists can be viewed in two density modes: **compact** and
**spacious**.

This is the compact mode. As opposed to this, the spacious mode shows tasks in a
more roomier list, alongside showing creation timestamps.

omm starts up with compact mode by default (you can change this, as we'll see
soon). You can toggle between the two modes by pressing `v`. Choose whichever
mode fits your workflow better.

Try it out. Come back to this mode once you're done.
