This is the archived list, meaning it holds tasks that are no longer being
worked on.

omm provides this list both for historical reference, as well as for you to be
able to move an archived task back into the active list.

You can toggle the state of a task using `<ctrl+d>`.

Press `tab/q/esc/<ctrl+c>` to go back to the active list.
