Let's get to the crux of omm: **adding** and **prioritizing** tasks. We'll begin
with adding tasks.

You can add a task below the cursor by pressing `a`. Once you get acquainted
with omm, you'll want to have more control on the position of the newly added
task. omm offers the following keymaps for that.

    o/a            add task below cursor
    O              add task above cursor
    I              add task at the top
    A              add task at the end

Go ahead, create a task, then move to the next guided item.
