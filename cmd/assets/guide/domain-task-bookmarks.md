Sometimes you'll add URIs to a task's summary or its context.
		
Such URIs could be placed anywhere in the summary/context. For example:

- https://c.xkcd.com/random/comic
- spotify:track:4fVBFyglBhMf0erfF7pBJp
- obsidian://open?vault=VAULT&file=FILE
- mailto:example@example.com
- slack://channel?team=TEAM_ID&id=ID

omm lets you open these URIs via a single keypress. You can either press `b` to
open up a list of all URIs, and then open one of them by pressing `‚èé` or open
all of them by pressing `B` (some of them will fail to be opened on your machine
since they point to non-existent resources, but you get the point).

Note: If a task has a single URI added to it, pressing `b` will skip showing the
list, and open the URI directly.

Try both approaches now.
