Sometimes you'll add URLs to a task's summary or its context.
		
Such URLs (eg. https://github.com/dhth/omm, https://tools.dhruvs.space,
https://c.xkcd.com/random/comic) could be placed anywhere in the
summary/context.

omm lets you open these URLs via a single keypress. You can either press `b` to
open up a list of all URLs, and then open one of them by pressing `‚èé` or open
all of them by pressing `B`.

Note: If a task has a single URL added to it, pressing `b` will skip showing the
list, and open the URL directly.

Try both approaches now.
