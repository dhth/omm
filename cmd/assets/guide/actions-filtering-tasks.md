You can filter tasks in a list by pressing `/`. Doing this will open up a search
prompt, which will match your query with task prefixes.

Try it out now. You get out of the filtered state by pressing `q/esc/<ctrl+c>`.

Note: You cannot add tasks or move them around in a filtered state. But, you can
move a task to the top of the list (by pressing `‚èé`). Doing this will also get
you out of the filtered state.
