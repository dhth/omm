At its core, omm is a dynamic list that maintains a sequence of tasks based on
the priorities you assign them.

And, as we all know, priorities often change. You're probably juggling multiple
tasks on any given day. As such, omm allows you to move tasks around in the
priority order. It has the following keymaps to achieve this:

    ‚èé              move task to the top
    J              move task one position down
    K              move task one position up

It's recommended that you move the task that you're currently focussing on to
the top.
