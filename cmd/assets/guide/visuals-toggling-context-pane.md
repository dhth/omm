The context pane can be toggled on/off by pressing `C` (capital c).

You can choose to display it or not based on your preference. For convenience,
the lists will always highlight tasks that have a context associated with them
by having a **(c)** marker on them.

omm starts up with the context pane hidden by default (you can change this, as
we'll see soon).
