This is a guided walkthrough to get you acquainted with omm's features.

Before we begin, let's get the basics out of the way: you exit omm by pressing %s. These keys also move you back menus/panes whilst using omm's TUI.

Onwards with the walkthrough then! Simply press %s, and follow the instructions.

As such, tasks are at the core of omm. A task can be anything that you want to keep track of, ideally something that is concrete and has a clear definition of done.

Tasks in omm have a one liner summary, and optionally, some context associated with them (like this paragraph). You can choose to add context to a task when you want to save details that don't fit in a single line.
